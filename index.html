            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello, I'm <strong>Tan Saj</strong>, a passionate and dedicated <strong>DevOps Engineer</strong> with a strong background in <strong>software development</strong>, <strong>cloud technologies</strong>, and <strong>automation</strong>. My journey into the world of DevOps began with my deep interest in streamlining processes and improving collaboration between development and operations teams.
            </p>
            <p>
                I specialize in creating efficient, scalable, and automated solutions that help businesses deliver high-quality software with speed and reliability. My expertise spans <strong>CI/CD pipelines</strong>, <strong>cloud infrastructure</strong>, <strong>containerization</strong> with Docker and Kubernetes, and <strong>version control</strong> using Git. I’m always eager to leverage cutting-edge technologies to solve complex challenges and improve the software lifecycle.
            </p>
            <p>
                With a <strong>Master’s degree in Computer Science</strong>, and hands-on experience working with various development tools and cloud platforms like <strong>Azure</strong>, <strong>AWS</strong>, and <strong>Google Cloud</strong>, I am committed to building seamless, automated systems that help organizations thrive in today's fast-paced, tech-driven world.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to my technical skills, I am a <strong>Scrum Master</strong>, which allows me to effectively manage teams and ensure smooth project delivery while maintaining agile practices. I am passionate about continuous learning and improving my craft, and I strive to stay ahead of industry trends and best practices.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I'm not solving technical problems or optimizing systems, I enjoy working on personal projects, contributing to open-source initiatives, and constantly evolving my skill set to stay on top of the rapidly changing tech landscape.
            </p>
            <p>
                Feel free to browse through my projects, and if you'd like to collaborate or discuss potential opportunities, don’t hesitate to reach out!
